👋 Hi, I’m Noorulla

Frontend Developer with 1+ year of professional experience building scalable, production-ready web applications using React.js and Next.js. I specialize in creating secure, high-performance user interfaces with a strong focus on authentication, state management, and clean UI architecture.

I have hands-on experience implementing:

🔐 Authentication systems (JWT, OAuth, protected routes, role-based access)

⚛️ React & Next.js (Pages Router, App Router, SSR, routing, middleware)

🧠 State management using Redux & Redux Toolkit

🎨 UI development with Tailwind CSS and Material UI

🚀 Performance optimization (code splitting, lazy loading, memoization)

🔗 API integration and pagination for large datasets

I enjoy solving machine-coding and DSA problems in JavaScript, and I actively build end-to-end projects such as e-commerce platforms and dashboards to strengthen my real-world problem-solving skills.

📌 Currently focused on:

Advanced React & Next.js patterns

Building enterprise-level authentication systems

Interview preparation through hands-on projects
